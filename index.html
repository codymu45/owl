      <h1>About the Great Horned Owl</h1>
      <p><strong>The great horned owl gets its name from the tufts of feathers on its head that look like ears. But the owl's ears are really farther down on the side of its head, and are just openings in the skull hidden beneath feathers. Its large eyes let it see in almost complete darkness, and if there is no light at all, its excellent hearing helps it hunt by sound. Owls are stealth hunters; they can easily sneak up on their prey since their fluffy feathers give them almost silent flight. When it finds prey, it dives and snatches it with its long, sharp talons. Great horned owls are very strong and can carry animals several times heavier than themselves! </strong></p>
